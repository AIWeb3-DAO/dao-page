ðŸ‘‹ About WagMedia
WagMedia decentralizes the story of Dotsama by incentivizing stakeholders to curate, share, create, and promote content of all languages in an open and transparent manner.

Founded in December 2021, WagMedia (WM) addresses the Polkadot ecosystem information distribution problem as it seeks to counter the diminishing ability of network participants to make informed decisions as the network grows. To achieve this, WM incentivizes individuals to discover, develop, and distribute network-related content.
         </h3>
         <h3 className='text-lg text-center leading-relaxed text-gray-300'>
         Participants can join the WM Discord server, register with their Substrate and EVM addresses, and engage in actions that align with the content objectives of participating treasuries. Contributors get rewarded based on their server actions and receive payouts from the respective treasuries every Monday.
